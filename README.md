## About the project
The B-CUBED (Biodiversity Big Data Cube) project is a European initiative aimed at standardising the way in which biodiversity data is stored. The main objective is to standardise biodiversity data to facilitate access, interoperability and use by researchers, policy-makers and the public.

## Objectives
- Standardisation of biodiversity data:** Create a common framework for the collection and storage of data, thereby ensuring their compatibility and facilitating their analysis.
- Facilitating access to data:** Set up an infrastructure allowing easy and open access to biodiversity data for all interested users.
- Use of AI and Deep Learning:** Develop and integrate advanced artificial intelligence and deep learning approaches to analyse the vast datasets collected, enabling the detection of trends, patterns and predictions about biodiversity.

## Deep-Learning approaches
Biodiversity data cubes, with their multidimensional structure, lend themselves perfectly to the application of deep learning techniques. These approaches enable large quantities of data to be processed and analysed efficiently, offering unprecedented insights into biodiversity. Deep learning models can help to
- Identify species from images or genetic sequences.
- Predict the impact of climate change.
- Analyse biodiversity trends on a global scale.
