## About the project
The B-CUBED (Biodiversity Big Data Cube) project is a European initiative aimed at standardising the way in which biodiversity data is stored. The main objective is to standardise biodiversity data to facilitate access, interoperability and use by researchers, policy-makers and the public.

## Deep-Learning algorithms for Species Distribution Modelling
Deep learning models have become increasingly prominent in the field of species distribution modelling. These models are capable of processing vast amounts of biodiversity data, effectively capturing the intricate, non-linear relationships between various environmental factors and the presence or absence of species. 


##  Datasets

### A use case (Belgium, 2010) for species classification using B-CUBED data 

#### Biodiversity Data
This dataset is a typical biodiversity dataset from the B-CUBED project in Belgium. It represents a subset from the year 2010, extracted from a more comprehensive dataset. The data is organized into spatial cubes to facilitate detailed biodiversity analysis for that year. For more information and access to the full dataset, please refer to the following resources.[https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0096919-240321170329656](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.e3j5kv).

#### Bioclimatic Rasters 

This dataset consists of 19 bioclimatic rasters obtained from the WorldClim and CHELSA databases. The rasters represent various environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and altitude.

### A subset from the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)

This subset is derived from the openly released recently (Elith et al., 2020), this subset includes presence-only and presence-absence data from Switzerland (SWI). It comprises data for 30 anonymized species from different biological groups. The dataset contains different environmental predictive variables for each region, including climatic, soil variables or location information (more details in Elith et al., 2020).
