## About the project
The B-CUBED (**Biodiversity Building Blocks for Policy**) project is a European initiative aimed at standardising access to biodiversity data to facilitate access, interoperability and use by researchers, policy-makers and the public.

## Objectives
- Use of AI and Deep Learning:** Develop and integrate advanced artificial intelligence and deep learning approaches to analyse the vast datasets collected, enabling the detection of trends, patterns and predictions about biodiversity.

## Deep-Learning approaches for Species Distribution Modelling
Biodiversity data cubes, with their multidimensional structure, lend themselves perfectly to the application of deep learning techniques. These approaches enable large quantities of data to be processed and analysed efficiently, offering unprecedented insights into biodiversity. Deep learning models can help to
- Identify species from images or genetic sequences.
- Predict the impact of climate change.
- Analyse biodiversity trends on a global scale.
